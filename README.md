# TriangleShooter
##What is it?
Triangle Shooter is fast-paced, top-down shooter, two-player game. The two combatants attempt to shoot at the other ship and destroy them. The first to 4 wins is the ultimate victor. Between rounds, the loser of the previous round chooses a ship attribute to increase in themselves and decrease in their opponent. Then, the round's victor chooses a different attribute to increase. This constantly shifts the balance of power and keeps matches competitive and unique.

##How to run it
The project must be downloaded and compiled with JavaFX. I used the 10.0.2 JDK to create the project. The runnable .jar file can then be run on any computer with Java installed. The two players must be on the same network for the game to run. First, the host must push the Host Button. Their IP Address is displayed in the output textbox in the launcher. Then, the other player inputs that address into the textbox below the Join button and presses Join.

##Controls
WASD to move. Space or left click to fire. E or Right click to fire all bullets as quickly as possible.
